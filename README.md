# CodingInBlind

This repo is mostly about using github pages with material for mkdocs 
to create and host content I hope will be interesting and useful to other blind developers.

See the 
[github pages for the codinginblind repo](https://joeldodson.github.io/codinginblind/)
for the content.
You can also get there through
[codinginblind.vip](http://codinginblind.vip)
which is currently a DNS redirect (which is why it's not https) through NameCheap to my github pages site. 

If I end up creating code examples specifically for Coding In Blind,
I'll host the code in this repo as well.

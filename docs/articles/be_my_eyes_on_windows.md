# Be My Eyes on Windows

These are notes on how to install and use the ```Be My Eyes``` application on Windows.

## Following Shaun of the Shed

Shaun Preece, of Double Tap fame, has a 
[video on his Shaun of the Shed channel on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bTJoxEYn6s)
covering most everything I'll cover here.
The app has changed slightly since his video, we'll cover those changes.

## Install from the Microsoft Store

I access the Microsoft store by pressing the windows key on my laptop, typing ```store```, and hit ```enter``` when I hear "Microsoft Store".

To get to the search area, press ```ctrl+e```.
Type in, "be my eyes", you don't have to have have spaces betw   een each of those words.
Then tab until you hear the Be My Eyes app announced.
You should eventually land on a button that says "free".
Click that button and folllow the installation instructions.

Once installed, you can launch Be My Eyes through the Windows key by typing "Be My Eyes" in the search.
In this case, you do need to include xpaces between each word.

## Might need to create account

The first time you open the app, it will ask you to log in, or create an account.
If you already use be my eyes on a mobile device, and have an account, you can use that one.
Else crating a new account is very simple; follow the steps in the app.

## Let's Start with Setings

Going through the settings will also give you a good idea of what all the app can do, including the keyboard shortcuts.

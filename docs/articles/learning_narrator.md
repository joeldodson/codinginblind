# Learning Narrator

Microsoft has been showing Narrator some love in Windows 11.
It's getting to the point of being a real option for your daily driver.
At the very least, it's a great option for getting unstuck when you run into problems while using other screen readers on Windows.
In this article we'll go through some of the basics and maybe even create some useful references for later.

If you are brand new to screen readers, this might not be the best resource to get started.
Hopefully you have access to a blindness organization to help learning the basics.
Once you have some screen reader fundamentals down, this resource should be at a good level of depth to get going with Narrator.

## Microsoft's Official Online Documentation 

IN the interest of teaching to fish (not giving out fish), the most important link you should know is 
[Microsoft support's Introduction to Narrator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1)

That page has two important areas, a table of contents with links and descriptions to chapters, and highlights of what's new in the latest release.
And it is well structured with semantic HTML.

If you want the table of contents, find the first HTML table then navigate by links to get to each chapter.
Each main feature in what's new is summarized under an HTML level 2 heading.

## First, Necessary Keyboard Shortcuts  

My first thought when learning a new screen reader is how do I change the voice, speed up the voice, and what can I configure.
But first, how to even get started.

### Turning on and off Narrator: ```windowsKey+ctrl+enter```

The keyboard command ```windowsKey+ctrl+enter``` toggles Narrator on and off.
That is technically a shortcut that can be disabled.
My experience though, especially at Costco and Best Buy, is that shortcut is enabled by default.

You can also exit Narrator with ```narratorKey+esc```.
I have no idea why there is a separate way to exit.

### Narrator Modifier Key: ```capsLock``` and ```insert```

Both the ```insert``` key and ```capsLock``` can be used as modifiers for Narrator.
As far as I know, the ```capsLock``` behaves identically to the ```insert``` key.
That's how NVDA works as well;
in either laptop or desktop mode, the ```capsLock``` works identically to the ```insert``` key.
In JAWS, on my 15 inch laptop with a full keyboard (including num pad), 
I found by configuring JAWS to use a desktop keyboard, and enabling ```capsLock``` as the JAWS key, there were slight functional differences between ```capsLock``` and ```insert```.


For simplicity, and less typing, I'll use the term ```capsLock``` when referring to the Narrator modifier key.

### Changing Voice Speed: ```capsLock+[minus/plus]```

The "minus" and "plus" are technically the hyphen and equals keys to the right of the 0 key near the top of the keyboard, below the function keys.
The increase/decrease voice speed is documented as ```ctrl+-``` and ```ctrl++```.
There is no need to hold down the shift key though to get the plus sign, it's simply an easy way to label that key.
If you have a keyboard with a num pad, the num pad plus and minus keys do not alter voice playback speed.

### Changing the Voice, and other configuration: ```windowsKey+ctrl+n```

This will launch you into the accessibility settings.
I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to poke around to learn the various configuration options.
After typing ```tab``` key a few times, you'll find the ability to change which voice synthesizer is used.

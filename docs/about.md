# About Coding In Blind

## Origin Story
I don't recall when I first thought of the idea for Coding In Blind.
And I don't know if I thought up the phrase myself, or heard it somewhere and forgot.
I did some searching on the phrase and check for already registered domains and came up empty.

In the Fall of 2023, I was on a call with other blind software developers.
The call was setup by another blind developer who was teaching Python to any interested blind people.
Some were very new to programming, some were new to Python.
I heard myself rambling on regarding using a virtual environment and my deep love for the REPL.
I realized no one was going to remember the examples I was giving (I wouldn't have at least).
It was time to finally put this idea in motion.

# Coding In Blind

## It's a play on words

Most people reading this page have probably heard the term "going in blind."
It generally means going into something without any, or very little, prior knowledge.
It's figurative, for most people.

This is a site initially created for the blind software developer community.
My intent is to write posts, with examples, and maybe even make videos 
showing coding with a screen reader.

I am by far standing on the shoulders of giants in this space.
There are many highly talented blind developers 
who have been developing software very successfully for decades.
I lost my sight in 2017 thus have been coding with a screen reader since then.
I guess another benefit I'm hoping to get from this site
is encouraging me to be better with the existing tools, so I can, maybe, someday, be one of those giants.

## Why the .vip domain?

Yes, to be sure, everyone these days is a very important person.
In blindness communities, VIP is often used as Visually Impaired Person.

As I was scrolling through NameCheap to determine if anyone else was using codinginblind, I found all the usual domains were available.
I thought, how about .io, it's cooler than .com.
Or maybe go retro with .net.
Then I scrolled to .vip and thought, "HA! It's got to be that one."

If you're paying close attention though, you'll see 
the address bar in your browser is no longer "codinginblind.vip".
I'm using a 3xx redirect from NameCheap to route requests to my github pages.
If this project really takes off, maybe I'll pay for github enterprise and use my own domain on pages.

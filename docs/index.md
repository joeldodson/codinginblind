# Coding In Blind

## It's a play on words

Most people reading this page have probably heard the term "going in blind."
It generally means going into something without any, or very little, prior knowledge.
It's figurative, for most people.

This is a site initially created for the blind software developer community.
My intent is to write posts, with examples, and maybe even make videos 
showing coding with a screen reader.

I am by far standing on the shoulders of giants in this space.
I lost my sight in 2017 thus have been coding with a screen reader since then.
There are many very talented blind developers 
who have been doing this very successfully for decades.
I guess another benefit I'm hoping to get from this site
is encouraging me to be better with the existing tools, so I can, maybe, someday, be one of those giants.
